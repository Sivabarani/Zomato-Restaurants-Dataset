**Understanding Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning involves predicting an outcome based on labeled data. Initially, I thought this dataset could be used for supervised learning.

**Objective**
The goal of this analysis is to identify the highest-rated restaurants. While the "rating" column is our main focus, we may also explore how other features relate to it, noting that they can be considered independent variables in this context.
